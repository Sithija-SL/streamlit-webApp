This is a simple Streamlit web application that allows users to explore and visualize the "Cars" dataset. The app provides various functionalities such as viewing tabular data, statistical summaries, correlation graphs, and different types of plots. Additionally, users can predict car prices based on engine capacity (CC).

Features
Home Page:

Display a header image of cars.
View the tabular data of the first 150 rows of the dataset.
View the statistical summary of the dataset.
Display a correlation graph (heatmap) of numeric columns.
Visualize the data using Scatter Plot, Bar Graph, or Histogram.
Vehicle Name Page:

Predict car prices based on engine capacity (CC) using a simple linear regression model.
